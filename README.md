# RecognizeMe
Unity based application for hand gesture recognition using Leap Motion device. 
The application demonstrates the usage of Leap Motion device and its capabilities for gesture recognition. As Leap Motion provides only a limited 
number of gestures that can be recognized, a simple solution has been developed that enables the user to enter his or her own
gestures. 

The idea behind the application is to provide the user with a fun way to learn the sign language. There are two main parts of this application.
The game part where user can play the game of recognition, that is, he is provided with the letter of the sign language that he needs
to guess or replicate with his own hand. The user has a limited time to achieve this task and gains points for every successful attempt.
On the other hand, the user can also enter his own, new gestures should he wish to practice beyond the scope of the application. This is enabled 
in the second part of the application dedicated to the creation of new gestures.

This application has been developed as a part of the Bachelor Thesis at the University of Zagreb.
